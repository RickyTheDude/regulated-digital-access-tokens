# Regulated Digital Access Tokens

## Project Overview

This project implements a custom **ERC-721 smart contract** that enforces **secondary market rules directly on-chain**.

Unlike standard NFTs:

- Peer-to-peer transfers are disabled
- All resales must happen through the contract marketplace
- Resale price is capped at **110%** of mint price
- **10% royalty** automatically goes to the original creator
